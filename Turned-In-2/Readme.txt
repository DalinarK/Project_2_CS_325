Instructions:

Type 'make' to compile the program.

The output for the algorithms will be put in the same txt file. 

ie Coint1.txt = 
[1, 5, 10, 25, 50]
75
[1, 10, 21, 50]
63
[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
120

output file (called Coin1change.txt) in order of Brute, Greedy, and Dynamic:
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
2
[0, 0, 3, 0]
3
[0, 0, 0, 1, 7]
8
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
